    <h2>India: The Tiger’s Promise</h2>
    <p>A hunter spared a tiger’s life, and it vowed to repay him. Years later, during a drought, the tiger led him to a hidden spring. But the water vanished when the hunter boasted, teaching humility. Some say the spring reappears for the kind-hearted.</p>

    <h2>Scotland: The Selkie’s Song</h2>
    <p>A fisherman stole a selkie’s seal skin, forcing her to be his wife. She bore him children, but her heart yearned for the sea. When her youngest found the skin, she sang a haunting goodbye and returned to the waves, her song still heard on stormy nights.</p>

    <h2>Mexico: La Llorona’s Tears</h2>
    <p>A woman drowned her children in a river after her lover left her. Cursed as a ghost, she now wanders, wailing “¡Mis hijos!” Her cries warn villagers to keep children safe near water, a tale of love and loss etched in the night.</p>
