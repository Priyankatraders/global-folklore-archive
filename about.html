    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p>I’m Priya, from India, and I started the Global Folklore Archive in March 2025. Growing up with stories from my grandparents, I wanted to preserve tales from every culture—myths, legends, and whispers of the past. This site is my passion, built by hand with no ads, just stories. Help me keep it alive!</p>
