        <h2>India: The Tiger’s Promise</h2>
        <p>A hunter spared a tiger’s life, and it vowed to repay him. Years later, during a drought, the tiger led him to a hidden spring. But the water vanished when the hunter boasted, teaching humility. Some say the spring reappears for the kind-hearted.</p>

        <h2>Scotland: The Selkie’s Song</h2>
        <p>A fisherman stole a selkie’s seal skin, forcing her to be his wife. She bore him children, but her heart yearned for the sea. When her youngest found the skin, she sang a haunting goodbye and returned to the waves, her song still heard on stormy nights.</p>

        <h2>Mexico: La Llorona’s Tears</h2>
        <p>A woman drowned her children in a river after her lover left her. Cursed as a ghost, she now wanders, wailing “¡Mis hijos!” Her cries warn villagers to keep children safe near water, a tale of love and loss etched in the night.</p>

        <h2>Africa (Ghana): Anansi’s Web of Stories</h2>
        <p>Anansi, the spider trickster, wanted all the world’s stories for himself. He went to Nyame, the sky god, who demanded three impossible things: a python, a leopard, and a hornet swarm. Using his cunning, Anansi trapped them in his web and won the tales. Now, every story begins with his name, a reminder of his cleverness—but also his greed.</p>

        <h2>Japan: The Yuki-onna’s Embrace</h2>
        <p>On snowy nights, the Yuki-onna, a pale snow woman, appears to lost travelers. Two woodcutters once met her in a blizzard. She spared the younger man, entranced by his warmth, but froze the older one with her icy breath. The survivor later married a mysterious woman—who vanished when he spoke of the Yuki-onna, leaving only a puddle behind.</p>

        <h2>Australia (Indigenous): The Rainbow Serpent’s Path</h2>
        <p>In the Dreamtime, the Rainbow Serpent carved rivers and mountains as it slithered across the land. It created waterholes for life but demanded respect. One tribe ignored its rules, and the Serpent unleashed a flood, swallowing them whole. Now, its colors shimmer in the sky after rain, a reminder of creation—and consequence.</p>
